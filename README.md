# About this project
just me trying out 3d models

## More
Was trying to experiment with 3d models and Three.js. The whole idea was to animate this beautiful heart model (link bellow), making it look like a realistic, beating heart, also adding a slider to allow user change the heart BPM and see how faster/slower heart beats (also adjusting the sound to it)

But it was quite impossible to make it look realistic using only library tools (also, my 3D animation skills are very poor and my experience with Blender is too traumatic)

I tried finding a pre-animated heart model to implement this idea, but couldn't find one that fit the project. So, what I ended up with is more of an "online art gallery" dedicated to a single, beautiful heart model

## Contribution

If you’d like to help bring this idea to life—by contributing an animated heart model or anything else—your contributions are welcome!

## Special Thanks

Thanks to Neshallads for providing this free 3D heart model on Sketchfab!
